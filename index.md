# Hi! I'm Amith Ravindar. I'm a teacher and a software developer.

After university I worked as software developer for 4 years, but I quit to work as a teacher of English and Computer Science for 4 years in Vietnam and Kyrgyzstan. Now I'm looking to work as a developer again.

Specialties: React, Python, PHP (Symphony, Laravel), AWS, Docker, DevOps

I also create Python and computer science-related tutorials on my Youtube channel, [The CS Classroom](https://www.youtube.com/c/TheCSClassroom/).

You can read more about me at my personal blog, [amith.life](http://amith.life).

## Olio
Technologies used: React, Firebase, Mobx (State Management)  
Deployment: Firebase

This is a simple application based on create-react-app to allow freelance
teachers to keep track of their students and their students' lessons. I built this for my wife, but also to demonstrate my React/Javascript abilities.

## EasyVax
Technologies used: Flask, Python, PostgreSQL  
Deployment: Heroku

EasyVax was built as a part of a series of tutorials ([Link](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqK_fRVXlXebDoOSZPM2lceqZ0_Lla6ye)) on my Youtube channel
to introduce my students to web development. I then upgraded it
significantly to demonstrate my own programming and DevOps capabilities.

It's a proof-of-concept vaccine passport system made for healthcare professionals to keep track of and provide patients with QR-code based proof of vaccination.
